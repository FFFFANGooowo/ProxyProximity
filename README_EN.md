## Easy Deployment on Deno Deploy üöÄ

Deno Deploy is a simple and user-friendly platform that offers free hosting for your code. Below are detailed deployment steps that you can easily follow, even if it's your first time! We will deploy by forking this project and configuring it on Deno Deploy.

### Step 1: Fork This Project üç¥

1. Log in to your GitHub account (if you don't have one, please register at [github.com](https://github.com)).
2. Visit the project repository page: [https://github.com/FFFFANGooowo/ProxyProximity](https://github.com/FFFFANGooowo/ProxyProximity).
3. In the top-right corner of the page, click the **Fork** button to copy this project to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy for you to manage and deploy.

### Step 2: Access Deno Deploy and Log In üåê

1. Open your browser and go to [dash.deno.com](https://dash.deno.com).
2. Click **Sign in with GitHub** to authorize Deno Deploy to access your GitHub account.
3. After logging in, you will be directed to the Deno Deploy dashboard.

### Step 3: Create a New Project üÜï

1. In the Deno Deploy dashboard, click the **New Project** button.
2. You will be prompted to choose a source; select **Deploy from GitHub**.

### Step 4: Select Your Forked Repository üìÇ

1. In the pop-up list of GitHub repositories, find the project you just forked (e.g., `your-username/ProxyProximity`).
2. Click on the repository to select it as the deployment source.

### Step 5: Name Your Project üé®

1. On the project setup page, enter a name for your project, such as `my-api-proxy`. This name will determine your proxy domain, e.g., `my-api-proxy.deno.dev`.
2. Make sure the name is concise and memorable, as it will be the domain you use in your applications.

### Step 6: Choose the Entry Point File üìÑ

1. On the same page, locate the **Entry Point** or **Main File** option.
2. Set it to `proxy.ts`. This is the entry file for our proxy application, and Deno Deploy will start the service with this file.

### Step 7: Deploy the Project üöÄ

1. After confirming all settings, click the **Deploy** button.
2. Deno Deploy will start building and deploying your project. Within a few seconds, you will see a success message, and your proxy service will be available at a domain like `https://my-api-proxy.deno.dev`.
3. Note down this domain; it will be your API proxy address.

### Step 8: Replace the Target Service Domain üîÑ

1. Suppose you want to proxy OpenAI's API, with the original URL being `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
2. Replace the domain part of the URL with your Deno Deploy domain, resulting in `https://my-api-proxy.deno.dev/api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
3. Use this new URL in your application to send requests. The proxy will automatically forward the request to OpenAI and return the result.

**Tip**: You can proxy any API service by embedding the target domain (e.g., `api.openai.com` or `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) after your Deno domain.

## Local Testing (Optional) üñ•Ô∏è

If you want to test the proxy service locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Deno**:
   - Visit [deno.land](https://deno.land/) and follow the instructions to download and install the Deno runtime environment.
2. **Run the Proxy**:
   - Open a command line, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
     ```
     deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read proxy.ts
     ```
   - The proxy service will start on `http://localhost:8000`.
3. **Use the Test UI**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`. You will see a test Web UI page.
   - Enter your API key and target API base URL (e.g., `api.openai.com`), select or input a model ID, and start a chat test.
   - This page supports streaming (SSE) and context management, and it displays detailed error messages to help you diagnose issues.
4. **Send Direct Requests**:
   - Alternatively, you can send API requests directly to `http://localhost:8000/api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` to confirm the proxy functionality.

## Usage Examples and Test UI üìã

**The URL provided by Deno is the address of the test Web UI** (e.g., https://your-project-name.deno.dev)
In addition to using the proxy URL directly in your code, you can also use the provided test UI page to quickly validate the proxy functionality. Below are some common API proxy methods for your reference:

- **Proxying OpenAI API**:
  - Original URL: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
  - Proxy URL: `https://your-project-name.deno.dev/api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
  - Authentication: Use `Authorization: Bearer your-api-key`
  - Testing Method: Enter your API key and `api.openai.com` in the test UI, select a model, and send a message.

- **Proxying Google AI API**:
  - Original URL: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models`
  - Proxy URL: `https://your-project-name.deno.dev/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models`
  - Authentication: Use `X-Goog-Api-Key: your-api-key`
  - Testing Method: Enter your API key and `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` in the test UI, fetch the model list, and select a model.
  - **Note**: If you are using an AI terminal that does not support Google format (e.g., Cherry Studio), ensure you switch to the correct API format or use a client specifically designed for Google API to avoid compatibility issues.

- **Proxying Anthropic API**:
  - Original URL: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete`
  - Proxy URL: `https://your-project-name.deno.dev/api.anthropic.com/v1/complete`
  - Authentication: Use `Authorization: Bearer your-api-key`
  - Testing Method: Enter your API key and `api.anthropic.com` in the test UI, select a model, and send a message.
  - **Note**: If you are using an AI terminal that does not support Anthropic format (e.g., Cherry Studio), ensure you switch to the correct API format or use a client specifically designed for Anthropic API to avoid compatibility issues.

**How to Pass API Keys**:
- You can pass the key in the request headers (e.g., `Authorization` or `x-api-key`), or add a query parameter `key=your-api-key` to the URL.

## Web UI Features in Detail üñºÔ∏è

ProxyProximity provides an intuitive and powerful Web UI for users to test and debug API calls. Below are the main features of the Web UI:
- **Configuration Input**: Users can input their API key and the full API base URL (e.g., `api.openai.com/v1` or `ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3`). The Web UI constructs the correct proxy URL based on the input and displays it for easy copying.
- **Model Selection and Customization**: Users can select a model from the fetched list or input a custom model ID in the text field. The custom input takes precedence over the selected model, ensuring flexibility and accuracy.
- **Chat Testing**: Users can type messages in the chat interface and send requests. The Web UI supports streaming (SSE) responses, displaying AI replies in real-time. It also supports Markdown formatting for better readability and aesthetics.
- **System Prompt Setting**: Users can set a system-level prompt (e.g., "Please respond in Chinese"), which is included in the request and influences the AI's response style. The prompt control is collapsible to save space.
- **Error Notification and Debugging**: If an error occurs during a request, the Web UI displays detailed error information, including HTTP status codes and specific error messages, helping users quickly diagnose issues.
- **Responsive Layout**: The Web UI uses a left-right layout, with configuration and model selection on the left and the chat interface on the right. On smaller screens, the layout automatically adjusts to a top-bottom arrangement for a better user experience.
